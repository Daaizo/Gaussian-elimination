# Gaussian-elimination
project for school, simple console app with 3 methods of Gaussian elimination and step by step solution. It has couple of prepared equations to test. It works really nice.
It lets user to 1.Pick prepared example  2.enter data manualy. 
After pressing 1 :

Next is picking a method 1.Simple Gaussian row reduced elimantion 2.Gaussian row reduced elimantion with finding max absoulute value in column 
3.Gaussian row reduced elimantion with finding max absoulute value in each step 

Next it asks if you want to show step by step solution, examples below:

and at the end there is solution. Informations displayed are in polish but variables are not so it should be easy to find out what is going on.
